# OpiAID

Version 1.0 of the OpiAID chatGPT powered chatbot. The bot is written in Python, and calls the chatGPT API to analyze patient data from a csv file.

# How To Use:
1. Run the python script in your terminal 
2. The bot will ask for the patients name. Use the First Last name of the patient that matches with a patient in the data file.
3. The bot will use the patients PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores to give the patient basic guidance, while still asserting that the bot should not replace medical advice and for the patient to speak to their doctor.


Currently the bot is rudimentary in what it can do, but I've found that the bot is able to use data from a database to make personalized predictions. I need to add some more capibilities for the user to chat with the bot, right now it just focuses on the data.
